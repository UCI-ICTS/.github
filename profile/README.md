# UCI Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS)

The UC Irvine Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the Clinical and Translational Sciences Award (CTSA) program. Currently, there are more than 50 medical research institutions throughout the United States that receive CTSA program funding.

The ICTS functions as a local centerpiece for the national program, and is dedicated to advancing scientific discovery and medical breakthroughs. Collectively, our goal is simple: to accelerate these discoveries from the lab and translate them into life-altering medical care.
